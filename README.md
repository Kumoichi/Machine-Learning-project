# Rice Type Classification Dataset

## Data Description
This dataset contains data for classifying rice into two types: Jasmine and Gonen. The dataset is provided in CSV format and has a size of 910 KB. It consists of 18,185 instances and 12 features, including id, Area, MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, Eccentricity, ConvexArea, EquivDiameter, Extent, Perimeter, Roundness, and AspectRation. All features are numeric values.

## Why Use this Dataset for a Machine Learning Project?
- Sufficient Data: With 18,185 instances and 12 features, this dataset provides enough data for analysis and accurate results.
- Numeric Features: All features are numeric values, making it suitable for regression analysis and clear feature correlation understanding.
- No Missing Values: The dataset is complete without any missing values, ensuring accurate analysis.
